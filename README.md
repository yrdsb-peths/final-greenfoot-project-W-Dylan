This game here is a modified version of pacman I made. Like pacman there is pacman who eats a bunch of pellets and tries to avoid ghosts.
Unlike pacman though there are no opportunities to eat the ghost back and there are a lot more ghosts to deal with.
In addition to that each pellet you eat gives you points and after every death you have an opportunity to use those points to better improve you game experience.
The goal of the game is to eat all the pellets before getting eaten
